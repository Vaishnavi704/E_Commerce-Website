E-Commerce Website-
A simple eCommerce web application built using Flask, MySQL, and HTML/CSS. It supports product listing, image display, and category-based navigation such as Casual and Formal wear. The backend is powered by Flask, which handles routing, server-side rendering with Jinja2, and interactions with a MySQL database that stores product data. The frontend offers a clean and responsive UI, allowing users to browse products, view details, and seamlessly switch between categories.
